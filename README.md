# Data_Manipulation_Attendance-Sheet
So, There was a time when I were to upload attendance for our colleagues in HRMS portal manually. we needed to upload employee attendance in our portal in a certain format.
With the help of 'pandas' and 'datetime' library I were able to manipulate the data from Biometric logs and write a CSV file which is in the format that HRMS accepts.
